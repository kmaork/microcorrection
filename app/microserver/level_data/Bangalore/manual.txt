OVERVIEW

    - The lock uses the first MSP430 ever to have memory protection.
    - This lock is attached the the LockIT Pro HSM-2.


DETAILS

    The LockIT Pro c.01  is the first of a new series  of locks. It is
    controlled by a  MSP430 microcontroller, and is  the most advanced
    MCU-controlled lock available on the  market. The MSP430 is a very
    low-power device which allows the LockIT  Pro to run in almost any
    environment.

    The  LockIT  Pro   contains  a  Bluetooth  chip   allowing  it  to
    communiciate with the  LockIT Pro App, allowing the  LockIT Pro to
    be inaccessable from the exterior of the building.

    There  is no  default  password  on the  LockIT  Pro HSM-2.   Upon
    receiving the  LockIT Pro,  a new  password must  be set  by first
    connecting the LockitPRO HSM to  output port two, connecting it to
    the LockIT Pro App, and entering a new password when prompted, and
    then restarting the LockIT Pro using the red button on the back.
    
    LockIT Pro Hardware  Security Module 2 stores  the login password,
    ensuring users  can not access  the password through  other means.
    The LockIT Pro  can send the LockIT Pro HSM-2  a password, and the
    HSM will  directly send the  correct unlock message to  the LockIT
    Pro Deadbolt  if the password  is correct, otherwise no  action is
    taken.

    Lockitall engineers  have worked for  over a year to  bring memory
    protection to  the MSP430---a  truly amazing achievement.  Each of
    the 256  pages can  either be executable  or writeable,  but never
    both, finally  bringing to  a close  some of  the issues  in prior
    versions.

    This  is Hardware  Version  C. It  contains  the all-new  modified
    MSP430  with hardware  memory protection.   This hardware  version
    also contains the Bluetooth connector  built in, and two available
    ports: the LockIT Pro Deadbolt should  be connected to port 1, and
    the LockIT Pro HSM-2 should be connected to port 2.

    This is Software Revision 01. The new firmware supports the memory
    protection we have introduced in this new hardware version.
